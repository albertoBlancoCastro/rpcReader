rpcReader

This code was made to read RPC systems (or others) for LIP RPC systems. Things to do first time. 

1 - Edit rpcReader/software/conf and modify 
    SYSTEMNAME  = 'mysystem';                  This is the name of your system
    HOME        = ['path'];                    this is the path of your repository => / ..../rpcReader/

2 - Assume this file as unchange. git will not track the changes on it. git update-index --assume-unchanged software/conf/initConf.m
